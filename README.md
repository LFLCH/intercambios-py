<b>Intercambios is a local network messaging system.</b><br>
It aims to connect devices of different types so that they can easily exchange data with each other.
It is currently based on TCP sockets. 

# intercambios-py
This repository contains the code of the Python scripts that are part of the Intercambios project.

## File structure
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œ app.py
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œ basic_server.py
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œ client.py
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œ qr_code.py
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“œ server.py
```
### _app.py_
It is the entypoint of the application. Running it provides a GUI that allow the interaction with the local network.<br>
It uses the Qt framework to do so.

![capture of the application](https://github.com/LFLCH/intercambios-py/assets/62034725/ac3e55f6-2ff3-4ec7-a479-81853550f089)

### _basic_server.py
It helped understanding how TCP socket server work. Its main disadvantage is that it blocks access to the console started (even ctrl+c does not work).

### _server.py_ && _client.py_
These scripts can be run independently, they provide a TCP client/server. Their output are in the console, and they can be stopped using ctrl+c signal.
